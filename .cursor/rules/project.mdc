# Cursor Skills Sync – project context

This folder is the **cursor-skills-sync** repo. Use it when working on skills, learning flow, or the dashboard.

## Layout
- **cursor/skills/** – Cursor custom skills (SKILL.md per skill)
- **cursor/skills-cursor/** – Cursor helper skills
- **codex/skills/** – Codex skills
- **learning/manual/**, **learning/generated/** – learning entries (draft); promote to skills when validated
- **ui/** – learning dashboard (single HTML, run via `./scripts/run-learning-ui.sh 8765`)

## Sync
- **to-local**: `./sync.sh to-local` – copy repo skills into `~/.cursor/skills` and `~/.codex/skills` (use after clone or pull)
- **to-repo**: `./sync.sh to-repo` – copy local skills back into this repo (then commit and push)

## Commands (from repo root)
- Run dashboard: `./scripts/run-learning-ui.sh 8765` then open http://127.0.0.1:8765
- Record learning: `./record-learning.sh manual "title" "details"` or `generated`
- Review/promote: use the web UI or `./scripts/review-learning.sh` / `./scripts/promote-learning.sh`

## Conventions
- Skills live in folders with a single `SKILL.md`. Validate with `./scripts/validateSkills.sh`.
- Learning entries use fingerprint (sha256 of source|title|details). Status: pending → approved/rejected → promoted.
