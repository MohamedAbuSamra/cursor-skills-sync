# Learning Flow (Manual vs Generated)

This flow keeps your improvements separate so you always know what came from you versus what was AI-generated.

## Draft vs Active (most important)

- Draft knowledge: `learning/*` (ideas, experiments, unproven patterns)
- Active behavior: `cursor/skills/*` and `cursor/skills-cursor/*` (`SKILL.md` files)

Only content in skill folders is treated as active skill guidance.

## Folder structure

- `learning/manual/` -> entries you add manually
- `learning/generated/` -> entries generated by AI during chats/work
- `learning/templates/` -> reusable entry template
- `cursor/skills/` -> active reusable skills
- `cursor/skills-cursor/` -> active Cursor-specific skills

## Daily workflow (5 minutes)

1. Record good patterns from your work:
   - Manual: `./record-learning.sh manual "short title" "what worked"`
   - Generated: `./record-learning.sh generated "short title" "ai-suggested pattern"`
2. Commit/push when ready.
3. Duplicate protection is automatic (same source+title+details is skipped).
4. Every new entry is created with `status: pending`.

## Reminder system

- A reminder is shown when pending learnings reach the threshold.
- Default threshold is `5`.
- Override threshold if needed:
  - macOS/Linux: `learningReviewThrasholder=10 ./record-learning.sh generated "..." "..."`
  - Windows (PowerShell): `$env:learningReviewThrasholder=10; .\record-learning.ps1 generated "..." "..."`

## Weekly workflow (15-20 minutes)

1. Review `learning/manual/entries.md`.
2. Review `learning/generated/entries.md`.
3. Promote the best ideas into:
   - `cursor/skills/` (global reusable)
   - `cursor/skills-cursor/` (Cursor-specific workflow)
4. Add a short note in commit message about promoted learnings.

## Promotion criteria (before moving to skills)

- Repeatedly useful in at least 2-3 real tasks
- Clear enough to write as instructions, not just an idea
- No conflicts with existing skills
- Includes at least one concrete example

## Review decisions

During review, update each pending entry to one of:

- `approved` -> valid idea, keep for later promotion
- `rejected` -> wrong or not useful; add reason in details
- `promoted` -> already moved into `skills/*`

### Command helpers

- Dashboard: `./scripts/learning-dashboard.sh 10`
- Review: `./scripts/review-learning.sh generated <fingerprint> approved "reason"`
- Promote: `./scripts/promote-learning.sh generated <fingerprint> my-skill-slug "description" skills`

## Rules for clean learning history

- Do not mix sources in one entry.
- Prefer short and specific entries.
- Add why it helped, not only what changed.
- Keep generated ideas until you validate them once in real usage.

## Example commands

```bash
# Manual learning from your own decision
./record-learning.sh manual "naming convention" "Use feature-based folder names for large modules."

# AI-generated learning from assistant output
./record-learning.sh generated "commit style" "Use conventional commits with scope for faster history scan."
```
