# Learning Flow (Manual vs Generated)

This flow keeps your improvements separate so you always know what came from you versus what was AI-generated.

## Folder structure

- `learning/manual/` -> entries you add manually
- `learning/generated/` -> entries generated by AI during chats/work
- `learning/templates/` -> reusable entry template

## Daily workflow (5 minutes)

1. Record good patterns from your work:
   - Manual: `./record-learning.sh manual "short title" "what worked"`
   - Generated: `./record-learning.sh generated "short title" "ai-suggested pattern"`
2. Commit/push when ready.

## Weekly workflow (15-20 minutes)

1. Review `learning/manual/entries.md`.
2. Review `learning/generated/entries.md`.
3. Promote the best ideas into:
   - `cursor/skills/` (global reusable)
   - `cursor/skills-cursor/` (Cursor-specific workflow)
4. Add a short note in commit message about promoted learnings.

## Rules for clean learning history

- Do not mix sources in one entry.
- Prefer short and specific entries.
- Add why it helped, not only what changed.
- Keep generated ideas until you validate them once in real usage.

## Example commands

```bash
# Manual learning from your own decision
./record-learning.sh manual "naming convention" "Use feature-based folder names for large modules."

# AI-generated learning from assistant output
./record-learning.sh generated "commit style" "Use conventional commits with scope for faster history scan."
```
